    "- In RL, state refers to information about the environemnt and then agent.\n",
    "- An RL algorithm inspects the state to decide which action to take.\n",
    "- Exactly what information gets captured in `state` depends on a few factors:\n",
    "  - The complexity of the environment: \n",
    "    - The number of actors, \n",
    "    - the nature of the environment, for example text or images. \n",
    "  - The complexity of the algorithm\n",
    "    - A simple algorithm may only need information about the agent and its immediate surroundings.\n",
    "    - A more complex algorithm may need information about the whole environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "- In our case we want the algorithm to only know about the location of the agent on the field. \n",
    "- We could have included information about the opponents too which would perhaps aid in the decision making but we chose not to.  \n",

    "- The state therefore is a tuple: (row, col), representing the location of the agent. \n",
    "- There are 20 possible values that `state` can take on:\n",
